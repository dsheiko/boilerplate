My book:
<h4>Cross-platform Desktop Application Development: Electron, Node, NW.js, and React</h4>
<p><i>I split the book in four tutorials, starting with basics and advancing progressively though more and more complex aspects. So the first part guides on creating a file-explorer built with pure JavaScript and NW.js/Node.js. The second part is about creating a chat with Electron, React and PhotonKit. The third part is about screen capturer made with NW.js, React/Redux and Material UI. The last part guides on creating RSS aggregator with Electron, React, Redux and TypeScript. </i></p>
